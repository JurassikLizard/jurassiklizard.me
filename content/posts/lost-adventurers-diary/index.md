# 0. Introduction
The following diary is a collection of recounts of my memories and experiences while travelling the galaxy.
Many are translated from non-native languages which I cannot speak well, and will be denoted wherever possible.
My journey began on my homeplanet, Traus Sector XB-II, in the year 201835 of Mattan. Mattan time, mandated by the New Republic, starts exactly 1 billion rotations after the formation of M31 at the center of the galaxy. 
Traus is considered a backwater amongst the planets in Sector XB-II, and government sloop ships rarely ever port there. Not even mentioning the merchant and military metallic masses that lumber around the galaxy with crews larger than the population of the whole planet.

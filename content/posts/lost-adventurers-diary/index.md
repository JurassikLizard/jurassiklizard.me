# 0. Introduction
## (translated by a Traussian-Earth translator)
The following diary is a collection of recounts of my memories and experiences while travelling the galaxy. \
Many are translated from non-native languages which I cannot speak well, and will be denoted wherever possible. \
My journey began on my homeplanet, Traus Sector XB-II, in the year 201835 of Mattan. Mattan time, mandated by the New Republic, starts exactly 1 billion rotations after the formation of M31 at the center of the galaxy. \
Traus is considered a backwater amongst the planets in Sector XB-II, and government sloop ships rarely ever port there. Not even mentioning the merchant and military metallic masses that lumber around the galaxy with crews larger than the population of the whole planet. \
Nonetheless, the glistening lakes that occupy the majoriy of the surface stud the planet like jewels. The glassy flat pools of water condense droplets from the air, summoning magnificent foggy landscapes, twirling and shimmering in the bright twin-star sunlight. I was born into a low-caste family, below the Rathazars, Lords, and Emperors. To those unfamiliar with Traussian culture, Rathazars, a difficult to translate word written by sounds rather than meaning, are below Lords, and own small estates suitable in size only for their close family. \
One cool morning, with the trees and grass swaying in the chilly breeze, a foreign-looking spacecraft touched down on the old, partially destroyed port. Understandably, this caused quite the commotion. The loud crowd pressed itself against the plastic barriers on the side of the landing platform, practically squishing everyone into a giant meatball. Weaving my way through the crowd, I turned into a dark tunnel.

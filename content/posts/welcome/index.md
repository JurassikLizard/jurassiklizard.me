Welcome to my personal corner of the web, in full vaporwave aesthetics! Hopefully the theme isn't too glaring on the eyes, and maybe you'll find something interesting!

I've added a GitHub based comments section - let me know if you want another system.

Hopefully there's more content to come, from programming adventures and AI adventures to my general musings on different topics.

Shoot me a comment if you have any suggestions!
